            <p>
              From the moment I dialed-up at the age of 12, I was intrigued by
              the online world. After creating my first website in raw HTML, I
              was hooked.
            </p>
            <p>
              In these 17 years, I've touched nearly every piece that makes the
              web work. From designing in Photoshop, mockups in cross-browser
              HTML/CSS (oh the days of IE5.5 compatibility), progressive
              enhancement with Javascript, writing a backend application through
              to setting up and running servers, DNS hosting, optimizing for
              search engines, and even buying and selling domain names.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love full-stack development and am particularly fond of
              Javascript, especially since Ryan Dahl's original Node.js demo in
              2009. I'm heavily invested in the user experience and always have
              end users in mind. And ultimately, I like to build cool things
              with cool people.
